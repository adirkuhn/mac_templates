Mac Templates
=============

A set of website templates for bootstrap 2 and 3 that includes:
  * A responsive website design (MacBeath)
  * A responsive e-commerce design (MacKart)
  * An admin backend design (MacAdmin)

I deleted the bootstrap 2 versions from the master and development branches
because bootstrap 3 is out and it's mo-betta. If you want the original,
unmolested templates, they can be found in the `original` branch.
